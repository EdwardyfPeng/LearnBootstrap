\title{Lattice-Ordered Alternatives Test}
\usage{
lb_lattice(matrix_data, n_permutations = 1000)
}
\arguments{
\item{matrix_data}{A numeric matrix where rows represent levels of Factor A and columns represent levels of Factor B.
The data should be arranged such that the hypothesized order increases with row and column indices.}

\item{n_permutations}{Integer. Number of permutations for the P-value calculation. Default is 1000.}
}
\value{
A list containing the observed test statistic (TL) and the permutation p-value.
}
\description{
Performs a nonparametric test for lattice-ordered alternatives using the Jonckheere-Terpstra type statistic.
It tests the null hypothesis of no difference against an alternative where the treatment effects follow a specific matrix ordering.
